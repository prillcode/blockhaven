# Jobs & Economy

Earn money by doing what you love! BlockHaven features a full economy system with jobs, trading, and more.

## How the Economy Works

On BlockHaven, you earn money by joining jobs and performing activities related to that job. Money can be used to trade with other players, buy items from shops, and more.

:::tip[Getting Started]

## Jobs System

Jobs let you earn money by doing everyday Minecraft activities. The more you work, the more you earn - and you level up to increase your pay rate!

Browse available jobs with `/jobs browse`. Here are some of the jobs you can join:

:::note[Multiple Jobs]
You can join multiple jobs at once! This lets you earn money from different activities. Use `/jobs leave [jobname]` to leave a job if you want to try something different.

## Job Leveling

As you work in a job, you earn experience and level up. Higher levels mean:

- **Better pay** - Each level increases your earnings
- **Increased experience** - Level up faster as you progress
- **Recognition** - Show off your dedication!

### Checking Your Progress

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/jobs stats` | See your level and experience in all jobs |
| `/jobs info [job]` | Detailed info about a specific job's pay rates |
| `/jobs top [job]` | See the top players in a specific job |

## Trading with Players

The player-to-player economy is a great way to get items you need and sell things you have extra of.

### Sending Money

Use `/pay [player] [amount]` to send money to another player. For example, `/pay Steve 100` sends $100 to Steve.

### Trading Tips

- **Agree on terms first** - Discuss what you're trading in chat before exchanging
- **Use a safe location** - Trade in a public area or your claimed land
- **Build trust** - Start with small trades before big ones
- **Be fair** - Ripping off other players is against our community spirit
