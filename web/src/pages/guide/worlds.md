# Worlds & Travel

BlockHaven features multiple worlds to explore. Learn how to navigate between them and what each offers.

## World Overview

BlockHaven uses the Multiverse plugin to offer multiple unique worlds. Each world has its own purpose, difficulty, and features.

:::warning[Important: Separate Inventories]
**Inventories and experience are NOT shared between worlds.** When you travel to a different world, you'll have a separate inventory, health, hunger, and XP. This means there's no gameplay advantage to teleporting - it's simply there to keep your experience fresh as you explore our various worlds!
:::

## The Spawn Hub

The Spawn Hub is the central connection point for all worlds. When you first join BlockHaven, this is where you'll arrive. From here, you can access any world through physical portals.

- **Central location** - All world portals are located here
- **Information center** - Signs explain each world
- **Safe zone** - No mobs or PvP in the hub
- **Community area** - Meet other players and chat

## Survival Worlds

BlockHaven offers three Survival worlds with different difficulty levels. Choose the challenge that's right for you!

### Easy Difficulty
Perfect for beginners or relaxed gameplay.
- Mobs deal less damage
- Hunger depletes slowly
- Health regenerates faster

### Normal Difficulty
The standard Minecraft experience.
- Balanced difficulty
- Standard mob damage
- Regular hunger mechanics

### Hard Difficulty
For experienced players seeking challenge.
- Mobs deal more damage
- Zombies can break doors
- Spiders can spawn with buffs

### Survival World Features

- **Safe zones** - Each world has a protected spawn area where mobs can't hurt you
- **Nether access** - Build a Nether portal to explore the Nether dimension
- **End access** - Find the stronghold to access the End and fight the dragon
- **Land claims** - Protect your builds in all survival worlds
- **Jobs & Economy** - Earn money while you play

## Creative Worlds

Creative worlds are perfect for building and exploring without the survival mechanics.

:::tip[Peaceful Building]
Creative worlds are set to **Peaceful difficulty**, meaning no hostile mobs will spawn. You're free to build and explore without worrying about monsters!
:::

### Creative World Features

- **Unlimited resources** - Access to all blocks and items
- **Flight** - Double-tap jump to fly
- **No hunger** - Focus on building without survival needs
- **Instant breaking** - Remove blocks instantly
- **Land claims** - Yes, claims work in Creative too!

## Traveling Between Worlds

There are two ways to travel between worlds on BlockHaven:

### Method 1: Physical Portals

The Spawn Hub contains portals to every world. Simply walk through the portal for your destination. Each portal is labeled with the world name and difficulty.

### Method 2: Teleport Commands

All players have permission to use the `/mvtp` command to teleport directly to any world. This is convenient when you want to quickly switch between worlds without returning to the hub.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mvtp [world]` | Teleport directly to a world |
| `/mv list` | List all available worlds |

**Example:** To teleport to the easy survival world, use `/mvtp survival_easy`. Use `/mv list` to see the exact names of all worlds.

## Per-World Inventories

Each world maintains its own separate inventory. This means:

- **Items don't transfer** - Your diamond pickaxe in one world won't be in another
- **Experience is separate** - XP earned in one world stays in that world
- **Health and hunger reset** - Each world has independent survival stats
- **Enderchests are shared** - Within the same inventory group, enderchests may be linked

:::note[Why Separate Inventories?]
Separate inventories ensure fair gameplay. You can't farm resources in Easy mode and use them in Hard mode, keeping each world's progression meaningful. It also prevents Creative mode items from entering Survival worlds.
:::

## Homes and Teleportation

Your `/home` locations are world-specific. Setting a home in one world only works in that world.

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/sethome [name]` | Set a home in current world |
| `/home [name]` | Teleport to your home in current world |
| `/spawn` | Return to current world's spawn |
| `/tpa [player]` | Request teleport to player (same world only) |

## World Travel Tips

- **Store important items** - Before switching worlds, make sure valuable items are safe
- **Use enderchests** - Enderchests can help transfer some items within inventory groups
- **Set homes in each world** - Have a home set in every world you play in regularly
- **Try different difficulties** - Each survival world offers a unique experience
- **Explore Creative** - Use Creative worlds to test build designs before building in Survival
