    <h2>What is Minecraft?</h2>
    <p>
      Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can build, explore, and survive in a blocky 3D world.
      Everything in the game is made of blocks that you can break and place. There are no set objectives -
      you decide what you want to do!
    </p>

    <p>On BlockHaven, we primarily play in <strong>Survival mode</strong>, where you need to gather resources,
    craft tools, and build shelter to survive. We also have <strong>Creative worlds</strong> where you have
    unlimited resources and can build anything you imagine.</p>

    <h2>Basic Controls</h2>
    <p>Here are the essential controls to get you started:</p>

  <section id="first-day">
    <h2>Your First Day</h2>
    <p>
      In Survival mode, you need to prepare before nightfall when monsters spawn. Here's what to do on your first day:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Punch a Tree</h3>
    <p>
      Hold down the break button on a tree trunk until it breaks. This gives you <strong>wood logs</strong>,
      the most basic and essential resource in Minecraft. Collect at least 10-15 logs to start.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Make a Crafting Table</h3>
    <p>
      Open your inventory (E key) and place logs in the 2x2 crafting grid to make <strong>planks</strong>.
      Then place 4 planks in a square to make a <strong>crafting table</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Craft Basic Tools</h3>
    <p>Place the crafting table and right-click it to open the 3x3 crafting grid. Make these essential tools:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sticks</strong> - Place 2 planks vertically</li>
      <li><strong>Wooden Pickaxe</strong> - 3 planks on top, 2 sticks down the middle</li>
      <li><strong>Wooden Sword</strong> - 2 planks on top, 1 stick below</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Gather Stone</h3>
    <p>
      Use your wooden pickaxe to mine stone blocks (the gray blocks found everywhere). Collect at least 20 cobblestone.
      Now you can make <strong>stone tools</strong>, which are much stronger than wooden ones.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Find or Build Shelter</h3>
    <p>
      Before it gets dark, you need shelter! Options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dig into a hillside</strong> - Quick and effective</li>
      <li><strong>Build a small hut</strong> - Use dirt, wood, or stone</li>
      <li><strong>Find a cave</strong> - Block off the entrance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Light It Up</h3>
    <p>
      Monsters spawn in the dark! Make <strong>torches</strong> by placing coal (found by mining stone) or charcoal
      (smelt logs in a furnace) above a stick in the crafting grid. Place torches inside your shelter.
    </p>

    <h2>Surviving the Night</h2>
    <p>
      At night, hostile mobs spawn in dark areas. Here's what you might encounter:

    <h2>Food and Hunger</h2>
    <p>
      Your hunger bar (the meat icons) depletes as you move and perform actions. When it's full, you regenerate health.
      When it's empty, you'll start taking damage!
    </p>

    <h3>Easy Food Sources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Animals</strong> - Kill cows, pigs, chickens, or sheep for raw meat. Cook it in a furnace for more hunger points.</li>
      <li><strong>Wheat</strong> - Find seeds from breaking tall grass. Plant them near water and wait for them to grow. Three wheat makes bread.</li>
      <li><strong>Apples</strong> - Occasionally drop from oak leaves when you break them.</li>
      <li><strong>Berries</strong> - Found on sweet berry bushes in certain biomes.</li>
    </ul>
