# Minecraft Basics

New to Minecraft? This guide covers everything you need to know to survive and thrive.

## What is Minecraft?

Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can build, explore, and survive in a blocky 3D world. Everything in the game is made of blocks that you can break and place. There are no set objectives - you decide what you want to do!

On BlockHaven, we primarily play in **Survival mode**, where you need to gather resources, craft tools, and build shelter to survive. We also have **Creative worlds** where you have unlimited resources and can build anything you imagine.

## Basic Controls

Here are the essential controls to get you started:

### Movement
- **W/A/S/D** - Move forward/left/back/right
- **Space** - Jump
- **Shift** - Sneak (crouch)
- **Double Space** - Fly (Creative mode only)
- **Ctrl** - Sprint

### Actions
- **Left Click** - Break blocks / Attack
- **Right Click** - Place blocks / Use items
- **E** - Open inventory
- **Q** - Drop item
- **T** - Open chat

:::note[Bedrock Players]
If you're playing on console or mobile, controls will vary. Generally, you'll use thumbsticks for movement, trigger buttons for breaking/placing blocks, and on-screen buttons for inventory and other actions.

## Your First Day

In Survival mode, you need to prepare before nightfall when monsters spawn. Here's what to do on your first day:

### 1. Punch a Tree

Hold down the break button on a tree trunk until it breaks. This gives you **wood logs**, the most basic and essential resource in Minecraft. Collect at least 10-15 logs to start.

### 2. Make a Crafting Table

Open your inventory (E key) and place logs in the 2x2 crafting grid to make **planks**. Then place 4 planks in a square to make a **crafting table**.

### 3. Craft Basic Tools

Place the crafting table and right-click it to open the 3x3 crafting grid. Make these essential tools:

- **Sticks** - Place 2 planks vertically
- **Wooden Pickaxe** - 3 planks on top, 2 sticks down the middle
- **Wooden Sword** - 2 planks on top, 1 stick below

### 4. Gather Stone

Use your wooden pickaxe to mine stone blocks (the gray blocks found everywhere). Collect at least 20 cobblestone. Now you can make **stone tools**, which are much stronger than wooden ones.

### 5. Find or Build Shelter

Before it gets dark, you need shelter! Options include:

- **Dig into a hillside** - Quick and effective
- **Build a small hut** - Use dirt, wood, or stone
- **Find a cave** - Block off the entrance

### 6. Light It Up

Monsters spawn in the dark! Make **torches** by placing coal (found by mining stone) or charcoal (smelt logs in a furnace) above a stick in the crafting grid. Place torches inside your shelter.

## Surviving the Night

At night, hostile mobs spawn in dark areas. Here's what you might encounter:

| Mob | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Zombies** | Slow but dangerous in groups. They burn in sunlight. |
| **Skeletons** | Shoot arrows from a distance. Also burn in sunlight. |
| **Creepers** | Silent and explosive! Run away if you hear a hiss. |
| **Spiders** | Can climb walls. Neutral during the day. |
| **Endermen** | Tall and teleporting. Don't look at their eyes! |

:::tip[Remember: BlockHaven Safe Zones]
On BlockHaven, each Survival world has a safe zone around spawn where mobs can't hurt you. If you're overwhelmed, head back to spawn to recover!
:::

## Food and Hunger

Your hunger bar (the meat icons) depletes as you move and perform actions. When it's full, you regenerate health. When it's empty, you'll start taking damage!

### Easy Food Sources

- **Animals** - Kill cows, pigs, chickens, or sheep for raw meat. Cook it in a furnace for more hunger points.
- **Wheat** - Find seeds from breaking tall grass. Plant them near water and wait for them to grow. Three wheat makes bread.
- **Apples** - Occasionally drop from oak leaves when you break them.
- **Berries** - Found on sweet berry bushes in certain biomes.

## Mining Basics

Mining is essential for gathering resources to craft better tools and equipment.

### Important Ores

| Ore | Depth | Use |
|-----|-------|-----|
| **Coal** | Anywhere | Fuel for furnaces, making torches |
| **Iron** | Y: -24 to 56 | Strong tools and armor, many crafting recipes |
| **Gold** | Y: -64 to 32 | Trading with Piglins, powered rails, golden apples |
| **Diamond** | Y: -64 to 16 | Best tools and armor, enchanting table |

:::tip[Mining Tips]
- Always carry torches to light your way and prevent mob spawns
- Never dig straight down - you might fall into lava or a cave
- Bring a water bucket to turn lava into obsidian if you encounter it
- Press F3 (Java) to see your coordinates and current depth (Y level)
