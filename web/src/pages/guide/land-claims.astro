    Protect your builds from griefing with BlockHaven's land claiming system.
  </p>

  <section id="overview">
    <h2>How Land Claims Work</h2>
    <p>
      Land claims create a protected area where only you (and players you trust) can build, break blocks,
      or interact with items. Claims extend from bedrock to sky limit, so you're protected at all heights.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-primary-gold/10 border border-primary-gold/30 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <h4 class="!mt-0 !text-primary-gold">Free Protection!</h4>
      <p class="!mb-0">
        Land claims are completely free on BlockHaven. You start with claim blocks and earn more
        as you play. There's no cost to protect your builds!

    <h2>Creating Your First Claim</h2>
    <p>
      When you join a Survival world for the first time, you receive a <strong>Golden Shovel</strong>
      in your Starter Kit. This is your claiming tool!
    </p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Equip your Golden Shovel</strong> - Hold it in your hand</li>
      <li><strong>Right-click the first corner</strong> - Click a block at one corner of the area you want to claim</li>
      <li><strong>Right-click the opposite corner</strong> - Click a block at the diagonal opposite corner</li>
      <li><strong>Done!</strong> - Your claim is now created and protected</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="bg-secondary-stone/10 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
      <h4 class="!mt-0">Auto-Claim Mode</h4>
      <p>You can also use auto-claim mode to claim land as you walk:</p>
      <ul class="!mb-0">
        <li>Type <code>/claim auto</code> to toggle auto-claim mode</li>
        <li>Walk around to automatically claim chunks as you move</li>
        <li>Type <code>/claim auto</code> again to turn it off</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="claim-blocks">
    <h2>Claim Blocks</h2>
    <p>
      Claim blocks determine how much area you can protect. You use claim blocks to create claims,
      and the size of a claim is calculated by the area you select.
    </p>

    <h3>Earning Claim Blocks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starting blocks</strong> - You begin with a set number of claim blocks</li>
      <li><strong>Playtime</strong> - You earn additional claim blocks for every hour you play</li>
      <li><strong>Accrued blocks</strong> - Claim blocks accumulate even if you're not actively claiming</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Checking Your Claim Blocks</h3>
    <p>Use this command to see your claim block status:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Command</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim list</code></td>
          <td>Shows your total, used, and available claim blocks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim info</code></td>
          <td>Shows details about the claim you're standing in</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section id="managing-claims">
    <h2>Managing Claims</h2>

    <h3>Viewing Claim Info</h3>
    <p>
      Stand inside any claim and type <code>/claim info</code> to see details about it,
      including the owner, area size, and trusted players.
    </p>

    <h3>Deleting a Claim</h3>
    <p>
      Stand inside the claim you want to delete and type <code>/claim delete</code>.
      This returns the claim blocks to your total.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-accent-redstone/10 border border-accent-redstone/30 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <h4 class="!mt-0 text-accent-redstone">Warning!</h4>
      <p class="!mb-0">
        Deleting a claim removes all protection. Make sure you really want to remove it
        before using this command!

  <section id="trusting-players">
    <h2>Trusting Other Players</h2>
    <p>
      Want to build with friends? You can grant different levels of trust to other players
      using the <code>/claim trust</code> command with different trust levels:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Command</th>
          <th>Permission Level</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim trust [player] ACCESS</code></td>
          <td><strong>Basic access</strong> - Can use buttons, levers, and doors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim trust [player] CONTAINER</code></td>
          <td><strong>Container access</strong> - Can open chests, furnaces, etc.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim trust [player] BUILD</code></td>
          <td><strong>Build access</strong> - Can build, break, and access containers</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>/claim trust [player] MANAGER</code></td>
          <td><strong>Manager</strong> - Can trust other players (be careful!)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Removing Trust</h3>
    <p>
      To remove a player's trust, stand in the claim and use <code>/claim untrust [player]</code>.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-accent-diamond/10 border border-accent-diamond/30 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <h4 class="!mt-0 text-accent-diamond">Trust Level Hierarchy</h4>
      <p class="!mb-0">
        Trust levels are hierarchical: MANAGER includes BUILD permissions, BUILD includes CONTAINER,
        and CONTAINER includes ACCESS. Give the minimum level needed for what you want players to do.

  <section id="stuck">
    <h2>Getting Unstuck</h2>
    <p>
      If you ever find yourself stuck inside someone else's claim and can't get out,
      use the <code>/unstuck</code> command to teleport to safety.

  <section id="tips">
    <h2>Tips and Best Practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Claim early</strong> - Protect your base as soon as you start building</li>
      <li><strong>Claim big</strong> - Leave room to expand by claiming extra space around your build</li>
      <li><strong>Check claim info</strong> - Use <code>/claim info</code> to see claim details anytime</li>
      <li><strong>Trust carefully</strong> - Only trust players you know and trust in real life</li>
      <li><strong>Use appropriate trust levels</strong> - Don't give BUILD when ACCESS is enough</li>
    </ul>
