# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to BlockHaven! This guide will help you get started on your adventure.

:::note[New to Minecraft?]
If you're completely new to Minecraft, check out our [Minecraft Basics](/guide/basics) guide first. It covers everything from your first night to crafting essential tools.
:::

## Step 1: Connect to the Server

BlockHaven supports both **Java Edition** and **Bedrock Edition**, so you can play from PC, console, or mobile.

| Edition | Address |
|---------|---------|
| Java Edition | `play.bhsmp.com` |
| Bedrock Edition | `play.bhsmp.com:19132` |

Need detailed connection instructions? Visit our [How to Connect](/connect) page, which includes step-by-step guides and console workarounds.

## Step 2: Explore the Spawn Hub

When you first join BlockHaven, you'll arrive at the **Spawn Hub** - a central area that connects all our worlds. From here, you can:

- **Walk through portals** to travel to different worlds
- **Read signs and information boards** to learn about each world
- **Access community resources** to help you get started

## Step 3: Get Your Starter Kit

When you enter any Survival world for the first time, you'll automatically receive a **Starter Kit** containing essential supplies to help you begin your adventure:

**Starter Kit Contents:**

- **Golden Shovel** - Used for claiming land (right-click two corners to claim)
- **Basic Tools** - Stone pickaxe, axe, and sword to get you started
- **Food** - Enough food to survive your first day
- **Torches** - Light up your first shelter

## Step 4: Know Your Safe Zones

Each Survival world has a **safe zone** around the spawn area where mobs and monsters cannot deal damage to players. This is especially helpful if you happen to spawn into a world at night!

:::tip[Pro Tip]
If it's nighttime when you spawn and you're not ready to face monsters yet, stay within the safe zone until dawn. You can use this time to check out the area and plan where you want to build.
:::

## Step 5: Your First Survival Steps

Once you venture out of the safe zone into the wilderness, here's what to do:

1. **Find a good spot** - Look for an area you'd like to call home. Consider proximity to resources, water, and interesting terrain.

2. **Claim your land** - Use your **golden shovel** to claim the area. Right-click one corner, then right-click the opposite corner. [Learn more about land claims](/guide/land-claims).

3. **Set your home** - Type `/sethome` to save your location. You can return anytime with `/home`.

4. **Join a job** - Earn money by doing what you love! Type `/jobs browse` to see available jobs. [Learn more about jobs & economy](/guide/economy).

## Essential Commands

Here are the most important commands to get you started:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
